* What is Econometrics

** What do you think of Econometrics?

- Economics?
- Mathematics?
- Statistics?


** Definition of Econometrics

Stock and Watson (2015) define Econometrics as

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At a broad level, econometrics is the science and art of using
economic theory and statistical techniques to analyze economic
data.
#+END_QUOTE


** Science or art?

- The principle of *falsifiability* of scientific research, as Karl Popper
  defined.

** Economic theory, statistics, and data

- A complete process of econometric research consists of
  - Economic theory
  - Statistical techniques
  - Economic data

* Economic Questions We Examine

** Question #1: Does reducing class size improve elementary school education?

*** The argument for small class size goes like this

Small classes get more teacher-student interaction, fewer disruptions,
and higher grades in test.

*** The question of interest

**** The research question

Is there any effect of reducing class size on improving students' grades in
elementary schools?

**** Who cares such research?

- Teachers
- Parents
- School principles
- Superintendents of school districts

*** The research design

- Qualitative research design :: A field investigation

- Quantitative research design :: Randomized controlled experiments
     (RCE, or randomized controlled trial, RCT)

*** The sample and data

- Draw samples and collect data from 420 California school districts
  in 1999. 
- Cross-sectional data. Each row represents a distinct unit of
  observation. All observations are collected in a single year.

*** The econometric model

- Use common sense to build an econometric model in this case. 
- Variables involved: the average test scores in a school district
  (/TestScore/) and the student-teacher ratio /STR/. 
- For simplicity, we set up a *simple linear regression
  model* as follows,

\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 STR + OtherFactors  \]

- The hypothesis we make is that if /STR/ has a non-zero effect on
  /TestScore/, that is, $\beta_1 \neq 0$. 

- The model is then estimated using some estimation method, and we
  test the hypothesis with the estimation results using some test
  statistics.


** Three other questions

- Question 1 :: Does reducing class size improve elementary school education?
- Question 2 :: Is there racial discrimination in the market for home loan?
- Question 3 :: How much do cigarette taxes reduce smoking?
- Question 4 :: What will the rate of inflation be next year?

*** A summary of data types

#+NAME: tab-data-types
#+CAPTION: Data types and econometric methods for all four questions
| Questions | Data types                     | Econometric methods                                |
|-----------+--------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| #1        | experimental, cross-sectional  | multiple regression                                |
| #2        | observational, cross-sectional | multiple regression with binary dependent variable |
| #3        | observational, panel data      | Panel data regression model                        |
| #4        | observational, time series     | multiple regression with lagged dependent variable |


* Causal Effects and Idealized Experiments

** Randomized controlled experiment

*** Randomized controlled experiments (or trials, RCTs thereafter)
- Clinical trials to test the effectiveness of medical
  intervention. 
- All participants are *randomly* assigned into two groups. 
- The control group receives no treatment (or placebo)
- The treatment group receives the treatment. 
- After a follow-up period, compare the two groups. 

*** An illustration of RCTs

[[file:figure/rct_example.png]]

*** The advantage of RCTs

- Randomization minimizes selection bias. 
- In the example of California school districts,
  randomized control experiments ensure that the only systematic difference
  between the classes in the control group and those in the treatment
  group is the treatment (reduced class size) itself, with the effects
  from other *confounding factors* eliminated. 

*** The disadvantage of RCTs

- Time and costs :: RCTs usually are expensive to undertake and take a
  long time to observe the effect of treatment.
- Conflict of interest dangers :: RCTs may be funded by special interest
  groups so that its objectivity is doubtful.
- Ethnics :: Especially in social science, we cannot impose some
  treatment due to ethnic concerns. 


** Causal effect

- *Causal effect* is defined to be the effect on an outcome of a given
  action or treatment as measured in an ideal RCT. 
- The concept of the ideal randomized controlled experiment does
  provide a theoretical benchmark to define causal effects in research
  design.

  
* Data Sources and Types

** Experimental versus observational data

- *Experimental data* come from experiments designed to evaluate a
  treatment or policy or to investigate a causal effect.
- *Observational (or nonexperimental) data* are collected using
  surveys, and administrative records.
- The problem of using observational data to estimate causal effects is
  that the "treatment" is not randomly assigned. 
- Much of econometric methods are developed to deal with
  causality using observational data.


** Cross-sectional data

- Data on different entities for a single time period are called
  *cross-sectional data*.
- The sequence of each observation number is arbitrarily assigned.
- Cross-sectional data can be experimental data or observational data.


** Time series data

- Time series data are data for a single entity collected at multiple
  time periods.
- The sequence of each record is based on the time period
  it happened. 


** Panel data

- *Panel data*, also called *longitudinal data*, are data for multiple
  entities in which *each entity* is observed at two or more time
  periods.
- Panel data are very useful for estimating causal effects. 
  time permits, we will cover some basic use of panel data at the end of
  this course.
