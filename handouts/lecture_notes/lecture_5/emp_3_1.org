Now we can show how to use R to do some statistical
analysis. This demonstration answers the questions of Empirical
Exercise 3.1 at the end
of Chapter 3. Furthermore, we carry out this exercise in the format of
*reproducible research*. That means, we should accomplish they
following tasks in answering the problem:
1) using R to compute the statistics
   asked in the questions
2) including R code and the results of running the code in the answer, and
3) describing our work and answers in plain language along with code
   and numerical answers.


* A description of the problem

Empirical exercise 3.1 concerns the relationship between average
earnings and education levels, using the data set from the 1992 and
2008 Current Population Survey (CPS). Specifically, we want to see
whether the average hourly earnings (=ahe=) are different between
workers with a bachelor degree and those with only high school
diploma (=bachelor=).


* Answers to the questions

** Question (a)

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Compute the sample mean for average hourly earnings (=ahe=) in 1992 and
in 2008. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population means
for =ahe= in 1992 and 2008 and the change between 1992 and 2008
#+END_VERSE

*** Read the data

The first thing first is of course read the data correctly from the
Stata file [[file:data/cps92_08.dta]], which can be read by the function
=read.dta()= in the package of =foreign=.

#+NAME: read-data
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output
  library(foreign)
  cpsdat <- read.dta("data/cps92_08.dta")
  head(cpsdat)
#+END_SRC

*** Calculate the sample means of average hourly earnings in 1992 and 2008

There are many ways to compute the sample means in 1992 and 2008,
respectively. First, to make you more familiar with the  R
language, we compute them in a very basic way. Then, we show how to
get the same results with some powerful functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output
  # extract the data for average hourly earnings in 1992 and 2008
  ahe.92 <- cpsdat$ahe[cpsdat$year == 1992]
  ahe.08 <- cpsdat$ahe[cpsdat$year == 2008]
  mean.ahe.92 <- mean(ahe.92); mean.ahe.92
  mean.ahe.08 <- mean(ahe.08); mean.ahe.08
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS[8885fe7066017107c646da902bf990f017b02cd3]:
: [1] 11.62637
: [1] 18.97609

The average hourly earnings are src_R{round(mean.ahe.92, 2)} dollars
in 1992 and src_R{round(mean.ahe.08, 2)} dollars in 2008.

*** Construct the confidence intervals

Recall that a 95% confidence interval for the population mean can be
constructed as $\overline{Y} \pm 1.96 SE(\overline{Y})$ and
$SE(\overline{Y})$ is computed as $s_Y / \sqrt{n}$.

#+NAME: compute the 95% confidence interval
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output
# the sample variance
sd.ahe.92 <- sd(ahe.92)
sd.ahe.08 <- sd(ahe.08)

n.92 <- length(ahe.92)
n.08 <- length(ahe.08)

# the standard error
se.ahe.92 <- sd.ahe.92 / sqrt(n.92)
se.ahe.08 <- sd.ahe.08 / sqrt(n.08)

# 95% confidence interval
# the 95% critical value from a normal distribution
cv.95 <- qnorm(0.975)

lower.lim.92 <- mean.ahe.92 - cv.95 * se.ahe.92
lower.lim.08 <- mean.ahe.08 - cv.95 * se.ahe.08

upper.lim.92 <- mean.ahe.92 + cv.95 * se.ahe.92
upper.lim.08 <- mean.ahe.08 + cv.95 * se.ahe.08
#+END_SRC

The 95% confidence interval for =ahe= in 1992 is
(src_R{round(lower.lim.92, 2)}, src_R{round(upper.lim.92, 2)}), and
that in 2008 is (src_R{round(lower.lim.08, 2)},
src_R{round(upper.lim.08, 2)}).

*** Alternative methods to calculate the sample means and confidence intervals

In the above example, to compute the sample averages in 1992 and 2008,
we write code separately for each year, which can be done more easily
in R.

We can compute the averages for each year using the function
=aggregate()=, which splits the whole data base into two parts by the
values of =year=. Then, for each part we compute the average by
specifying the argument =FUN= to be =mean=, i.e., specifying the
function to be used for each part as the =mean()= function. Also, in
this case, we use =~= to specify a *formula* that means that we split
=ahe= by =year=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output
  # Use aggregate() to compute the means in both years
  ahe.means <- aggregate(ahe ~ year, FUN = mean, data = cpsdat)
  ahe.means
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS[1d26776687726519ee92a5d12bfec8a148b24269]:
:   year      ahe
: 1 1992 11.62637
: 2 2008 18.97609

The confidence interval can be extracted from the results of the
=t.test()= function, which is a list.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output
  # t test for ahe in 1992
  t.ahe.92 <- t.test(ahe.92); t.ahe.92$conf.int
  # t test for ahe in 2008
  t.ahe.08 <- t.test(ahe.08); t.ahe.08$conf.int
  # test for the change between 1992 and 2008
  t.ahe.diff <- t.test(ahe.08, ahe.92); t.ahe.diff
#+END_SRC

	Welch Two Sample t-test

sample estimates:

 18.97609  11.62637
#+end_example

The confidence interval of the change in average hourly earnings
between 1992 and 2008 is (src_R{round(t.ahe.diff$conf.int[1], 2)},
src_R{round(t.ahe.diff$conf.int[2], 2)}).

** Question (b)

Now we need to adjust the average hourly earnings in the 1992 dollars
to the 2008 dollars with the inflation rate, computed as
=CPI2008/CPI1992=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :results silent
  # CPI in 1992 and 2008
  cpi.92 <- 140.3
  cpi.08 <- 215.2
  # Inflation adjustment
  inflator <- cpi.08 / cpi.92
  cpsdat$ahe.adj <- with(cpsdat, ifelse(year == 1992, ahe * inflator, ahe))
#+END_SRC

In the code block above, we first use the function =with()= to attach
the data frame =cpsdat= within its own environment so that when we
refer to variables in =cpsdat=, such as =ahe= and =year=, we do not
need to write =cpsdat$= and every time we use its variables.

The function =ifesle()= set the values of =ahe= based on the
condition ~year == 1992~. If the condition is true, we do =ahe *
inflator=; if not, leave =ahe= as it is.

Then we repeat what we've done in Question (a) with the
inflation-adjusted earnings in 1992.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :results silent
  ahe.92.adj <- with(cpsdat, ahe.adj[year == 1992])
  mean.ahe.92.adj <- mean(ahe.92.adj)
  t.ahe.92.adj <- t.test(ahe.92.adj)
  t.ahe.diff.adj <- t.test(ahe.08, ahe.92.adj)
#+END_SRC

- The sample average of the inflation-adjusted earnings in 1992 is
  src_R{round(mean.ahe.92.adj, 2)} in the 2008 dollars.

- The confidence interval for the inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings in 1992 is
  (src_R{paste0(round(t.ahe.92.adj$conf.int, 2), collapse = ", ")}).

- The confidence interval for the change between 1992 and 2008 is
  (src_R{paste0(round(t.ahe.diff.adj$conf.int, 2), collapse = ", ")}).

** Question (c)

If we are interested in the change in workers' purchasing power, the
results with the inflation-adjusted earnings should be used in
comparison.

** Question (d)

Now let's compute the average earnings for high school graduates and
college graduates with the 2008 data. First thing to do is to select
the 2008 data from =cpsdat= using the function =subset()=

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code
  # select data in 2008
  cps08 <- subset(cpsdat, year == 2008, select = c(year, ahe, bachelor))

  # calculate means
  ahe.educ.08 <- aggregate(ahe ~ bachelor, FUN = mean, data = cps08)

  # select ahe and filter by bachelor
  ahe.high.08 <- with(cps08, ahe[bachelor == 0])
  ahe.bach.08 <- with(cps08, ahe[bachelor == 1])

  # construct confindence interval
  t.ahe.high.08 <- t.test(ahe.high.08)
  t.ahe.bach.08 <- t.test(ahe.bach.08)
  t.ahe.gap.08  <- t.test(ahe.bach.08, ahe.high.08)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

- The mean of the average hourly earnings of high school graduates in
  2008 is
  src_R{round(ahe.educ.08$ahe[1], 2)}
  dollars with the 95% confidence interval
  (src_R{paste0(round(t.ahe.high.08$conf.int, 2), collapse = ", ")})

- The mean of the average hourly earnings of college graduates is
  src_R{round(ahe.educ.08$ahe[2], 2)}
  dollars with the 95%
  confidence interval
  (src_R{paste0(round(t.ahe.bach.08$conf.int, 2), collapse=", ")})

- The 95% confidence interval of the gap in earnings between the two
  groups is
  (src_R{paste0(round(t.ahe.gap.08$conf.int, 2), collapse=", ")})

We can create a boxplot to compare the means and confidence intervals
of average hourly earnings between high school graduates and college
graduates.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results value graphics :file figure/boxplot.png
  boxplot(ahe ~ bachelor, data = cps08,
          main = "Average Hourly Earnings by Education",
          col = c("red", "orange"),
          xlab = "Bachelor degres = 1, high school = 0",
          ylab = "US$ 2008")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** COMMENT Question (e)

We repeat the steps in (d) by replacing the 2008 data with the 1992
data and using the inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :results value
  # select data in 2008
  cps92 <- subset(cpsdat, year == 1992, select = c(year, ahe.adj, bachelor))

  # calculate means
  ahe.educ.92 <- aggregate(ahe.adj ~ bachelor, FUN = mean, data = cps92)

  # select ahe and filter by bachelor
  ahe.high.92 <- with(cps92, ahe.adj[bachelor == 0])
  ahe.bach.92 <- with(cps92, ahe.adj[bachelor == 1])

  # construct confindence interval
  t.ahe.high.92 <- t.test(ahe.high.92)
  t.ahe.bach.92 <- t.test(ahe.bach.92)
  t.ahe.gap.92  <- t.test(ahe.bach.92, ahe.high.92)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

- The sample mean of the inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings of high
  school graduates in 1992 is
  src_R{round(ahe.educ.92$ahe.adj[1], 2)}
  dollars with the 95% confidence interval
  (src_R{paste0(round(t.ahe.high.92$conf.int, 2), collapse=", ")}).

- The mean of the inflation adjusted average hourly earnings of
  college graduates in 1992 is
  src_R{round(ahe.educ.92$ahe.adj[2], 2)}
  dollars with the 95% confidence interval
  (src_R{paste0(round(t.ahe.bach.92$conf.int, 2), collapse=", ")}).

- The 95% confidence interval of the gap in earnings between the two
  groups is
  (src_R{paste0(round(t.ahe.gap.92$conf.int, 2), collapse=", ")}).

** COMMENT Question (f)

To answer this question, we need to compare the following pairs:
- =ahe.high.92= v.s. =ahe.high.08=: compute the average of the gap,
  and the 95% confidence interval of the gap;
- =ahe.bach.92= v.s. =ahe.bach.08=: compute the average of the gap,
  and the 95% confidence interval of the gap;
- =ahe.bach.08 - ahe.high.08= v.s. =ahe.bach.92 - ahe.high.92=:
  compute the average of the gap, and the 95% confidence interval.

However, there is a problem in such comparison. Namely, the length of
=ahe.high.92= and =ahe.high.08= are not the same. So are =ahe.bach.92=
and =ahe.bach.08=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output
  # High school earnings increase
  change.ahe.high <- ahe.high.08 - ahe.high.92
  length(ahe.high.08)
  length(ahe.high.92)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Warning message:
: In ahe.high.08 - ahe.high.92 :
:   longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
: [1] 4002
: [1] 4643

To circumvent this problem, we can select a subset the samples in 1992
and 2008 so that the length of data in each year is the same. Let's
randomly draw 1000 of samples from each year, and compute the gap in
earnings of high school graduates between the 2008 and 1992.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code
  # Draw random samples from 1992 and 2008

  nsmp.high.92 <- sample.int(length(ahe.high.92), 1000, replace = TRUE)
  nsmp.high.08 <- sample.int(length(ahe.high.08), 1000, replace = TRUE)

  ahe.high.08.smp <- ahe.high.08[nsmp.high.08]
  ahe.high.92.smp <- ahe.high.92[nsmp.high.92]

  gap.high.0892 <- ahe.high.08.smp - ahe.high.92.smp
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

With these random samples, we can compute the mean and the confidence
interval.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :results output
  mean.gap.high.0892 <- mean(gap.high.0892)
  t.gap.high.0892 <- t.test(gap.high.0892)
  ci.gap.high.0892 <- t.gap.high.0892$conf.int
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

The story does not end here. How come we trust the results from one
set of random samples of the data? To alleviate the doubt, we can
randomly choose another 1000 random samples and calculate the mean and
confidence interval, and do it again for another set of 1000 random
samples, and repeat the same steps for thousands of times. That is, we
do an iteration of the same procedure comprising random sampling and
computing the mean and the confidence interval in each step.

In R, we can do a =for= loop or a =while= loop. In this case, let's
start with a =for= loop.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :results output
  niter <- 9999
  mean.gap.high <- NULL
  ci.gap.high <- NULL

  for (i in 1:niter) {

      nsmp.high.92 <- sample.int(length(ahe.high.92), 1000, replace = TRUE)
      nsmp.high.08 <- sample.int(length(ahe.high.08), 1000, replace = TRUE)

      ahe.high.08.smp <- ahe.high.08[nsmp.high.08]
      ahe.high.92.smp <- ahe.high.92[nsmp.high.92]

      gap.high.0892 <- ahe.high.08.smp - ahe.high.92.smp

      mean.gap.high.0892 <- mean(gap.high.0892)
      t.gap.high.0892 <- t.test(gap.high.0892)
      ci.gap.high.0892 <- t.gap.high.0892$conf.int

      mean.gap.high <- c(mean.gap.high, mean.gap.high.0892)
      ci.gap.high <- rbind(ci.gap.high, ci.gap.high.0892)
  }

  mean.gap.high.smp <- mean(mean.gap.high)
  ci.gap.high.smp <- apply(ci.gap.high, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

- The mean of the gap in earnings of high school graduates between
  1992 and 2008 is src_R{round(mean.gap.high.smp, 2)} dollars.
- The confidence interval of the gap is
  (src_R{paste0(round(ci.gap.high.smp, 2), collapse = ", ")}).
