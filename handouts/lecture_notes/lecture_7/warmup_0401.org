* Question 1 

In the simple linear regression model $Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + u_i$,

 - A :: the intercept is typically small and unimportant.
 - B :: $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1$ represents the population regression function.
 - C :: the absolute value of the slope is typically between 0 and 1.
 - D :: $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1$ represents the sample regression function.

* Question 2

The OLS estimator is derived by

- A :: connecting the $Y_i$ corresponding to the lowest $X_i$ observation with the $Y_i$ corresponding to the highest $X_i$ observation.
- B :: making sure that the standard error of the regression equals the standard error of the slope estimator.
- C :: minimizing the sum of absolute residuals.
- D :: minimizing the sum of squared residuals.

* Question 3

The following are all least squares assumptions with the exception of:

- A :: The conditional distribution of $u_i$ given $X_i$ has a mean of zero.
- B :: The explanatory variable in regression model is normally distributed.
- C :: $(X_i, Y_i), i=1, \ldots, n$ are independently and identically distributed.
- D :: Large outliers are unlikely.
