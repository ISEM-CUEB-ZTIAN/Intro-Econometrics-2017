* Course description
** Objectives

Econometrics is a subject in Economics, consisting of "economic
tricks" for quantitative analysis and becoming an indispensable
component in economists' toolbox. The roles of Econometrics include,
but not limited to, quantitatively examining the relationship between
various economic variables, giving empirical support to economic
theories, making forecasts about economic performance in the future,
and evaluating policy impacts, etc. At an introductory level, this
course want to achieve the following goals: (1) letting students know
basic econometric methods and theories, (2) enabling students to use
software, primarily R, to estimate a simple econometric model, and (3)
making students be aware of the notion of reproducible research as a
standard workflow of empirical research.

Serving for these ends, the contents of this course will cover single
and multiple linear regression model, the ordinary least squares
estimation, hypothesis testing, model specification assessment,
detection and solutions to problems in regression, such as,
heteroskedasticity and multicollinearity, and panel data model. If
time is permitted, we will also cover such topics as instrumental
variable methods, and the Probit and Logit models. This course will
not cover Time Series Econometrics except for a touch on the
concept of serial correlation. This course will lay out a solid
foundation for the future series of Econometric courses, such as
Intermediate Econometrics, Time Series Econometrics, and Advanced
Econometrics.


** Prerequisite

Principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, Calculus,
Introductory Probability and Statistics, and Linear Algebra.

exercises, pratical quizzes, and STATA tutorial. You can also download
datasets for empirical homework in Baidu Cloud.


* Course assignments
** TODO Homework

- Homework will be assigned every other week, aiming to help
  understand fundamental concepts in econometric theories and grasp
  basic estimation and testing methods through practice and
  applications.

- Each homework will consist of two parts, theoretical questions and
  empirical exercises, which are all selected from the end-of-chapter
  exercises in the textbook of Stock and Watson. 

- The due day of each homework will be on Monday of the immediate
  following week after it is assigned. I strongly suggest you
  not wait until the last minute before the due day to work on your
  homework. 

- You can finish your homework by either handwriting or typesetting
  using word process software, e.g., Microsoft Word, LaTex, and the
  like. Typesetting is highly recommended.

- Homework will be graded as A, B, C, and D, based on the following
  rule
  + A: homework is submitted by the due time. Numeric and mathematical
    answers are correct for all questions with only minor
    mistakes. Explanations to your answers are convincing with correct
    use of econometric terminology. English writing is clear and
    grammatically right. (A = 100 percent points)
  + B: homework is submitted by the due time. Numeric and mathematical
    answers are correct for most questions. Explanations are sound but
    may not be totally right. English writing is a little obscure with
    minor grammatical errors. (B = 85 percent points)
  + C: homework is submitted by the due time. Numeric and mathematical
    answers are correct for almost half of questions. Explanations may
    not be right but correctly using related econometric
    terminology. English writing is just understandable with obvious
    grammatical errors. (C = 70 percent points)
  + D: homework is submitted by the due time. Numeric and mathematical
    answers are correct only for a few questions. Explanations are
    wrong but with some merits. English writing is poor in both
    understanding and grammar. (D = 60 percent points)
- Homework must be submitted by the due time. A grace period of late
  submission can be granted by request in advance. If granted, you
  must turn in your homework two days after the due day. Late
  submission of homework is subject to downgrading score to a lower
  level. No submission at all will result in no score on the homework.
  
*** TODO Add a policy for group work in homework


** Mid-term examination

- The mid-term exam will cover most materials taught from Week 5 to
  Week 9.
- It is tentatively scheduled on *May 9th, Monday*.
- This will be a closed-book test. But you are allowed to bring a
  one-sided "cheat sheet", on which you can write down some notes that
  help you remember some important definitions and formulas. You are
  allowed to write on *only one side* on the cheat sheet.
- If you miss the mid-term exam, a make-up test can be arranged. You
  must notify me in advance of your absence with a valid excuse.


** Final examination

- The final exam will be comprehensive, covering all being taught
  throughout the semester.
- The time and location are to be arranged and announced by the
  university.
- This will also be a closed-book test. But you are still allowed to
  bring a "cheat sheet" written on *both sides* this time.
- The make-up test will follow the rule of the university.
