This website contains the course materials for the course of
Econometrics offered at ISEM, CUEB, in the 2nd semester of the
2016-2017 academic year.

* Announcement

** [2017-03-22 Wed]

- [[*Homework set #2][Homework set #2]] is assigned, due on *April 5th*.


** [2017-03-20 Mon]

You can download the following files, [[file:handouts/lecture_notes/r_docs/Reference%20Card.pdf][Rreferencecard.pdf]] and
[[file:handouts/lecture_notes/r_docs/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf][Rcheatsheet.pdf]], which can help you quickly find relevant R commands.


** [2017-03-06 Mon]

- I create a survey, https://www.diaochapai.com/survey2500285, to
  inquire your understanding of probability and statistics and ask for
  your suggestion to this course. Please complete the survey in your
  spare time. Thanks!
