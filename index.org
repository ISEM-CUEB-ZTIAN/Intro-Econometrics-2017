* Announcement

** [2017-03-06 Mon]

- I create a survey, https://www.diaochapai.com/survey2500285, to
  inquire your understanding of probability and statistics and ask for
  your suggestion to this course. Please complete the survey in your
  spare time. Thanks!

- [[*Homework set #1][Homework set #1]] is assigned, which is due on *March 13*.
